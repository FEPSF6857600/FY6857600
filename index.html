<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>
    A geomagnetic storm is a large disturbance which occurs in Earth’s magnetosphere. It happens when there is an exchange of energy from the solar wind into the space. Geomagnetic storms can destroy satellites or develop a strong current within wires. There are different kinds of Solar phenomena which are the things such as Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), solar prominence, filaments, sunspots and solar flares. The effects on technological systems including power grids, satellite communications, and navigation systems are caused by coronal mass ejections and solar flares. This article includes the mechanisms behind geomagnetic storms and their effects in the past, and the significance of modern monitoring in reducing potential risks.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
    Geomagnetic storms, often viewed as a natural hazard, pose a significant risk to critical infrastructure. These storms occur when solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetic field. Notable historical events like the Carrington Event of 1859 and the Quebec blackout of 1989 exemplify the destructive potential of these storms (NESDIS, 2023). Understanding their mechanisms and preparing for potential disruptions are essential for modern society.

<p><strong>Mechanisms Behind Geomagnetic Storms</strong></p>
<p>
    Geomagnetic storms occurs when there is a massive exchange of energy from the solar wind to the space near earth. For example, attack on magnetic field by CME’s or developed solar wind streams causes geomagnetic storms. A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a plasma and magnetic energy from the sun’s corona that can exceed 1500km/s. After making it to the earth’s and compressing to the magnetic field, letting the charged particles are entering to the atmosphere near the poles where they form auroras (NESDIS, 2023). Moreover, another solar wind disturbance that makes geomagnetic storms to occur more is a high-speed solar wind stream (HSS). HSS’s produce co-rotating interaction regions of CIRs when it interacts with the slower-moving solar wind. These situations are often correlated with geomagnetic storms. Although it is less than CME storms, it can accumulate more energy in Earth’s magnetosphere over a long period of time. CIRs are knowns as making recurring geomagnetic disturbances and often occurs when the phase of the solar cycle diminishes. When CIRs make it to Earth, it creates auroras and changes the satellite and communication systems (NOAA,2023).

    <strong>How Geomagnetic Storms affect Earth’s Infrastructure</strong>
     A geomagnetic storm also has impact on power grids and earth’s magnetic field. For instance, it can cause blackouts and interfere with satellites and high frequency radio communications (USGS 2023; NESDIS,2023).
Moreover, the main drawback of increased radiation during geomagnetic storms have effect on astronauts such as it can lead to health risk on during spacewalks or long-during missions (NOAA, 2023).

<p>This table illustrates how geomagnetic storms affect technological systems and the strategies employed to mitigate these effects.</p>

    <p>Geomagnetic storms also produce auroras on Earth and during these events, Auroras can be more visible as far south as Alabama and northern California (NOAA’s, n.d.). To see the auroras   as clear as possible, the viewing area should be with minimal light pollution and clear skies with no clouds around.</p>

<p><strong>Historical and Recent Events</strong></p>
<p>
    In the past, the Carrington event is the most powerful event ever recorded creating widespread telegraph damages and making auroras more visible near the equator. Even though the most influential storm on record was the Carrington Event (1859), recent storms such as the April 2023 event have proved that even modest storms can make significant technological harms. The geomagnetic storm in April 2023 caused widespread auroras and affected satellite operations because of a CME traveling approximately two million miles per hour have reached a G4 level on NOAA’s storm scale.
</p>

    <p><strong>Monitoring and Forecasting</strong></p>
    <p>
        The progress of space weather forecasting has helped to predict geomagnetic storms. Satellites such as NOAA’s DSCOVR is regularly observing solar wind conditions. To predict the intensity of storms, DSCOVR gathers information on the speed, density and magnetic field of solar wind which are the key factors. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center is to supply warnings and alerts from the data.
NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center provides alerts to help power grids and satellite systems to take advantage of the proactive measurements to prevent possible risks.
 A lot of efforts on forecasting have been successful for reducing the impact on the technology-dependent system.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>
    <p>
        Modern technology system is getting affected by geomagnetic storms directed by solar phenomena like coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares. Significant events that happened in the past such as like the Carrington Event of 1859, mentioning the ruinous possibilities of severe storms. Additionally, to improve the capacity to anticipate and reduce their effects there are important satellites such as like NOAA’s DSCOVR. Agencies like NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center is for timely alerts enables to take preventive measures also helping to avoid risk of disruption to power grids, satellites and communication networks. To prevent any challenges posed by space weather investigation in predicting capabilities are critical to technology-dependent systems.
